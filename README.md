### Prioject Name: AGRISTAND - Climate Monitoring Device Connected with Cloud based on IoT

### Abstract
Agriculture remains the most important sector of Bangladeshi economy, contributing 19.6 percent to the national GDP and providing employment for 63 percent of the population. Agriculture in Bangladesh is heavily dependent on the weather, and the entire harvest can be wiped out in a matter of hours when cyclones hit the country. According to the World Bank, the total arable land in Bangladesh is 61.2 percent of the total land area (down from 68.3 percent in 1980). Currently 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) is one of the most discussed issues in Bangladesh. This is why, Agriculture sector in Bangladesh is developing by digitalization with AI, Data analysis & Machine Learning,

AGRISTAND is a climate monitoring device by uses AI and microelectronics groundbreaking for farmers, soil scientists, and environmental scientists containing microprocessors, sensors, proper databases, and many other components. This device should be available for cultivation because it will properly assist the farmers to have knowledge about the condition of the soil and climate by testing air humidity, temperature, and soil moisture, field rainfall, atmospheric Pressure. By using this data analyzing it properly and giving the proper information about cultivation to farmers about their land quality and telling them how much fertilization they will have to use on their land and how much yield they will get. it also helps soil scientists and environmental scientists. The whole processed data and results will show on a Mobile App installed on a smartphone and also on the Website.

### Keywords
Green farming, Climate, Sensors, AI, Database Microprocessor, Mobile App, Data Analysis, IoT

### Process & Methodology
1.	Sensors collecting Data from soil and air. And processing this data using a microprocessor, and sending it to our cloud database via the internet using Wi-Fi. It totally follows the rule of green farming.
2.	By using this data users will take a decision. Cloud also saves this data for analysis at other times.
3.	In the device, Solar Panel gives the power to the battery, which will generate the power for the microprocessor through a Voltage generator.
4.	Analyzed data will be stored in the cloud and the proper result or decision will show in the mobile app, which is previously installed

### Main components of AGRISTAND 
#### Soler panel 
1.	Soler panel produce power for charging battery inside the device’
2.	Produced power will charge the battery.
#### Battery  
1.	Battery produced power to the microprocessor (ARDUINO).
2.	It helps the device for continuous operation.
#### Sensors (On air and Underground)
1.	Sensor read the data from air and ground. 
2.	It will send the data to the microprocessor.
#### Wi-Fi Module, Database and Cloud
1.	Wi-Fi module will be used for transforming data to databased using internet. 
2.	AI process and resulting this this data. 
#### Website and Mobile App
1.	After processing, this result will be shown on website and apps.
2.	It will also save the result and data for analysis in future.

### Application 
1.	When the sunlight will hit the solar panel then it will produce power for the battery. Using a voltage regulator battery will produce 5V in the microprocessor. 
2.	All the sensor collects the data from the surrounding medium of the land (soil & air). 
3.	By using the internet through the Wi-Fi module data will be sent from AGRISTAND to a web-based database.
4.	After analyzing the results and decision will be shown to the farmers in mobile apps and saved the data.

### Advantages
1.	Using this device farmers will easily know about the condition of his land and surrounding medium.
2.	It will reduce the hardship of farmers and will increase yields. It fully based on green farming.
3.	It will help the farmers to gain the proper knowledge about the climate.
4.	Using this device soil scientists and environmental scientists use data for scientific experiments. 
5.	Using solar panel, it is totally green energy based and it is friendly for climate.

### Disadvantage 
1.	It’s a little bit costly to build and setup this device and Farmers have to spend some money for internet connection.
2.	This device has some technical errors. Like data collecting, voltage supply, processing, data analysis, etc. This type of work sometimes doesn’t give proper results. That will hamper fertilization.
3.	It will also hamper scientific experiments.

### Future Prospects
In this modern era, technology in agriculture sector is important topic which is follow the green farming and no hunger (SDG-2). It will helpful to establish SDG-8 & SDG-9. In Bangladesh, agriculture is a very important as well as others sector for GDP. This device will help in this purpose.
